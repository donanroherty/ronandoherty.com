BeatDaddy is a practice tool for musicians. It combines a metronome with a chord drone, allowing musicians to practice in time and within a harmonic context.
You can also accent specific beats to aid in targeting specific beats or simulating genre specific rhythms.

I built BeatDaddy to use in my bass and guitar practice routine. I like to drill arpeggios and scales over the chord drone or remove accents from beats to improve timing.

BeatDaddy is a **Progressive Web App** built in React and Typescript.
