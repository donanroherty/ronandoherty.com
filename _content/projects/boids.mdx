This is my overbaked version of the classic Boids algotithm, an artificial life simulation first written by Craig Reynolds in 1986.
I say overbaked beacuse the original algorithm uses just 3 simple force; Cohesion, Alignment and Separation.  Hovever there's a lot of room to add to these rules.  Here's list of some things I've included in my version:


- Predator boids which hunt smaller boids
- Spatial Hashing for boid and collider lookup
- Quad Tree for boid lookup
- Interactions between flocks
- Obstacle avoidance
- Swept collisions with static geometry
- Field of view controls
