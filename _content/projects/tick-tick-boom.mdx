Tick Tick Boom is a winning Unreal Engine game jam entry I made in January 2016. My intention was to keep the project as simple as possible while adding as much polish as I could in the three days I had to complete everything.
Originally made in blueprints, I completely rewrote Tick Tick Boom in C++ as a learning exercise and made a few improvements along the way.

It has a few cool features such as:

- procedurally built and animated assets
- camera that dynamically frames actors
- data driven stages, adding new stages is as simple as editing a spreadsheet
