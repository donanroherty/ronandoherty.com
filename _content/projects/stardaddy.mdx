StarDaddy is a Chrome extension for management and re-discovery of starred GitHub repositories. It syncs
data locally, enabling lightning fast searching and filtering.

StarDaddy uses a tag system to filter repositories. Detected repo languages are used as default tags, soon you will be able to create custom tags allowing for deep categorization.

I built StarDaddy to help me re-discover useful repositories amongst the 300+ repos I have starred. It's already improving my workflow, I hope it 's useful to you too.
