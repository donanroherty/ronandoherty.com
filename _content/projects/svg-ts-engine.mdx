In this tutorial, I will show my approach to building a simple real-time 2D engine with Typescript.
I will assume you have a basic grasp of Typescript, are using Yarn package manager, and Visual Studio Code as your code editor of choice.

## Overview

I will be keeping the stack as simple as possible. For the most part, the only external libraries I use will be Typescript and a local web server.

This article will cover:

- Creating the initial project files
- Setting up Typescript
- Serving the built JavaScript in the browser

Part 2 will cover building the engine itself using Typescript to create a starting point for any real-time 2D project.

Part 3 will use the engine to create a simple game.
